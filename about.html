            <p class="cohost">
                20Something & Living is a podcast featuring co-hosts, Therese, 27, and Krista, 26. Therese
                is frank and sarcastic while Krista is passionate and persistent, an odd mix. But for these two -- it
                works! Their chemistry makes for an entertaining bunch with lots of laughs! The podcast speaks to women
                like them, 20Something and finding their way. They premiere a new episode every other Tuesday on iTunes
                & Soundcloud.

                    facts. As of right now, she says she is taking life one day at a time, all the while trying to get
                    it together.
