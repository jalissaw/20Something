            <p class="cohost">
                20Something & Living is a podcast featuring co-hosts, Therese, 27, and Krista, 26. Therese
                is frank and sarcastic while Krista is passionate and persistent, an odd mix. But for these two -- it
                works! Their chemistry makes for an entertaining bunch with lots of laughs! The podcast speaks to women
                like them, 20Something and finding their way. They premiere a new episode every other Tuesday on iTunes
                & Soundcloud.

                    Therese was born and raised in St. Louis. She is a down-to-earth, sarcastic woman who is always up
                    for a good laugh. She is a recent graduate of the University of Central Missouri, School of

                    updated on pop culture, you can find her on youtube researching conspiracy theories and random
                    facts. As of right now, she says she is taking life one day at a time, all the while trying to get
                    it together.
